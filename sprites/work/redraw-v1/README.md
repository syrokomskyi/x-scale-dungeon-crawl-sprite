v3.0.0

Draw a **realistic dark fantasy reinterpretation** of the original pixel art (see attachment). 
Keep the **same composition, silhouette, and pose**, as well as the **relative layout of background elements**.
This is a **dramatic, cinematic reinterpretation**, not a copy.

Render the creature (item, object, building, etc.), its armor, and surroundings with:
- **Realistic materials** (metal, bone, leather, fabric, stone, mist, etc.).
- **High-detail textures** and **volumetric lighting**.
- **Cinematic shadows** and **strong light direction** (like from a torch, spell, or moon).
- **Atmospheric depth**, with subtle fog, floating dust, and background blur.
- **Dynamic tension** and **epic scale feeling**, as if from a movie still.

The atmosphere should feel **moody, ancient, and mythic**, combining realism with fantasy.
Do not try to make the creature biologically plausible — interpret it artistically, as a **dark mythic entity**.

**Style references:** 
Dark Souls / Elden Ring / Diablo IV / Magic: The Gathering / Greg Rutkowski / Magali Villeneuve / Wētā Workshop concept art.

Use the attached pixel image as reference for **composition and silhouette**, but reinterpret every surface, light, and texture in **a fully rendered, realistic way**.
