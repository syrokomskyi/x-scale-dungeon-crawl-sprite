Draw a **realistic dark fantasy reinterpretation** of the original pixel art (see attachment) and description:

[description from https://github.com/crawl/crawl/blob/master/crawl-ref/source/dat/descript/monsters.txt]

Keep the **same composition, silhouette, and pose**, as well as the **relative layout of background elements**.
This is a **dramatic, cinematic reinterpretation**, not a copy.

Render the creature (item, object, building, etc.), its armor, and surroundings with:
- **Realistic materials** (metal, bone, leather, fabric, stone, mist, etc.).
- **High-detail textures** and **volumetric lighting**.
- **Cinematic shadows** and **strong light direction** (like from a torch, spell, or moon).
- **Atmospheric depth**, with subtle fog, floating dust, and background blur.
- **Dynamic tension** and **epic scale feeling**, as if from a movie still.

Like a still frame from a dark fantasy film, captured with cinematic lighting and lens blur.

Imbued with arcane glow, symbols faintly carved into armor, magical energy flickering in the mist.

Depict the creature as a mythic abomination, awe-inspiring and terrifying, blending beauty and horror.

The atmosphere should feel **moody, ancient, and mythic**, combining realism with fantasy.
Do not try to make the creature biologically plausible — interpret it artistically, as a **dark mythic entity**.

**Style references:** 
Dark Souls / Elden Ring / Diablo IV / Magic: The Gathering / Greg Rutkowski / Magali Villeneuve / Wētā Workshop concept art.

Use the attached pixel image as reference for **composition and silhouette**, but reinterpret every surface, light, and texture in **a fully rendered, realistic way**.
